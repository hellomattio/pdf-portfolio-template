  "My nephew, Henry, was born with severe hearing loss. His hearing ability was limited to 110 dB, the magnitude of which would cause others hearing damage. It was declared he would need hearing aids for the rest of his life. Even then, this would only get him to around 50-60 dB. Still not enough to hear or distinguish speech."

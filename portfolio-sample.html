  <!-- <h1 id="1" class="section">Introduction</h1>
	<p>My nephew, Henry, was born with severe hearing loss. His hearing ability was limited to 110 dB, the magnitude of which would cause others hearing damage. It was declared he would need hearing aids for the rest of his life. Even then, this would only get him to around 50-60 dB. Still not enough to hear or distinguish speech.</p>

	<p>Instead of getting hearing aids, Henry underwent surgery to receive Cochlear implants. Fast forward four years, thanks to an incredibly encouraging family and rapid advances in auditory technology, Henry is able to listen, comprehend and speak. His hearing ability no longer limits his development.</p>

  <p>For those with Cochlear Implants, having control and visibility of the sound processors is critical to the overall experience and success of the hardware. These functions are currently performed by a proprietary hardware device.</p>

	<p>I am confident that the benefits of these implants can be extended even further, by creating a platform to control these processors with our mobile devices. A platform that is intuitive, responsive and easily upgradable as new features become available. Additional features could include reports on how long the processor has spent in each mode, to give parents feedback on how much their child is engaging with others at school. It could also provide alerts if the childâ€™s processor becomes disconnected, or is low on battery. Further extended features could include an integrated Ling sound test, which is able to provide real time feedback and automated processor calibration.</p>

  <p>With this vision in mind, the following project was created to explore how these features could be presented on an iOS device.</p> -->
